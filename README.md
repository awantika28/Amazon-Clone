# Amazon-Clone
Created an Amazon clone using HTML and CSS, drawing inspiration from external sources. Through this project, I honed my CSS skills, exploring flexbox, grid layout, and responsive design. This hands-on experience provided insights into UI design and the importance of attention to detail. Excited to continue leveraging these skills for future web development projects.
